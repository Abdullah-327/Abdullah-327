- Hi, I’m @Abdullah-327.
- I’m interested in coding related to Artificial Intelligence.
- I’m currently learning python, I already have learnt basics of C++ and a vast area of HTML.
- I have made some simple projects using python, have attached them at the end.
- I’m looking forward to projects which can not only enhance my learning skills, but can also get me a fair earning.
- You can reach me by email: abdullahrashid0308@gmail.com.
- I'm currently studying A'levels, means I'll be available on weekends from 7:00 PST to 21:00 PST, availability on weekdays is less likely due to college hours.
